# Just-Jenae
Website portfolio for Jenae Luthi's original work 

This is a mock up of a Portfolio webpage created to showcase my 
original projects.  I only currently have one, so I used it in 
multiple sizes to show that I know how to add multiple pictures 
with links and accessible descriptions. I added media queries to 
my CSS to make different size screens compatible with my Webpage.
My nav bar has links, hover, active and visited elements. I have 
added rounded corners to my profile pic and created a spot to have
contact information added should I choose to use this Portfolio.  I 
kept the layout and color scheme simple, because that is how I 
prefer things to look.
